# Da Platform - Container Image Encryption

## Overview

Container Image Encryption is a security-focused project aimed at ensuring the confidentiality of container images stored in registries. The project introduces encryption techniques to protect images at rest and securely manage encryption keys.

## Features

- **Image Encryption at Rest:** Encrypts container images before pushing them to a registry.
- **Secure Key Management:** Uses asymmetric encryption for managing encryption keys.
- **Efficient Access Control:** Only authorized users can decrypt and use encrypted images.
- **Docker Integration:** Works seamlessly with Docker, Buildah, and OpenSSL.
- **Enhanced Security:** Protects container images from unauthorized access, even if the registry is compromised.

## Installation

To use Container Image Encryption, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker & Buildah:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io buildah
   ```

2. **Install OpenSSL:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssl
   ```

3. **Generate RSA Key Pair:**

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out private.pem 10240
   openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
   ```

## Usage

### Encrypt & Push an Image

```bash
buildah push --encryption-key public.pem image_name docker://registry_url
```

### Pull & Decrypt an Image

```bash
buildah pull --decryption-key private.pem docker://registry_url
```

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a **web platform** that manages encrypted container images. Each image and user has a unique **public-private key pair**, ensuring secure access control.

- **Admins** manage user access and encryption keys.
- **Users** encrypt their images before pushing and decrypt them after pulling.

## Encryption Process

1. **User generates an RSA key pair.**
2. **Before pushing, the image is encrypted** using the public key.
3. **Image is pushed to the registry** in an encrypted format.
4. **To pull, the user provides their private key** for decryption.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker** â€“ Containerization platform
- **Buildah** â€“ CLI tool for building and pushing images
- **OpenSSL** â€“ Cryptographic encryption tool
- **.NET Framework** â€“ Backend development

## Future Work

- Upgrade framework from .NET Framework 4 to **.NET 6** for better performance and security.
- Improve **UI/UX** for a more seamless experience.
- Implement **secure communication channels** for image transfer.
